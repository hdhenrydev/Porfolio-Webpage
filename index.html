      <h2> About Me </h2>
			<p>Hello, I am Henry Duong. I am an aspiring Software Developer located in Boston, MA. I studied Computer Science at Northeastern University for undergrad, but was never able to complete my degree. At Thinkful I hope to fufil one of my dreams of becoming a Software Developer by learning web development.  
        
      <p>I have learned to become a team player through various jobs I have work through, from scooping ice cream at an ice cream shop to working as a programmer at a company that sells goods at Amazon. At the hardest times when things mattered the most, I have tried my best to contribute everything I can.
      </p>

			<p>Outside of coding, I like to play chess, enjoy video games, and work out to relieve stress.
      </p>

      <p>Some of the languages I have dabbled with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Scheme</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
      </ul>
